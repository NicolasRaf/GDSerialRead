## About the Project

`GDSerialRead` offers a straightforward solution for reading serial data directly in Godot, making it ideal for integrating external devices like Arduino with the engine. This project was initially developed to simulate and capture data from an Arduino Esplora in a Linux environment, enabling real-world hardware and software interactions in a game environment.

## Requirements

- [**Godot Engine - .NET**](https://godotengine.org/download/windows/) 4.3 or higher.
- [SDK do .NET 8](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/pt-br/download) version usade in project.
- Build System.IO.Ports in project paste: ```dotnet add package System.IO.Ports```
